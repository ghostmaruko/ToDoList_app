# 📝 To-Do List App (jQuery Version)

## 📌 Description

This project is a simple **To-Do List** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**, a popular JavaScript library. The application allows users to:
- Add new items to a list
- Mark items as completed
- Delete items from the list
- Reorder the list items

The main goal is to practice using **jQuery** to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and apply dynamic styling, simplifying tasks that would normally require more code in vanilla JavaScript.
